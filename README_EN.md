## 📝 Project Introduction

Command Sender is a powerful tool for sending commands to various terminal windows. It sends commands accurately to specified terminal windows by simulating keyboard input, supporting multiple terminal types, and helping users improve work efficiency.

## ✨ Main Features

- 🎯 **Multiple Terminal Support**: Compatible with PowerShell, MobaXterm, SecureCRT, Xshell, PuTTY, Windows Terminal, etc.
- ⌨️ **Simulated Keyboard Input**: Reliable keyboard event simulation via Windows API
- 📋 **Clipboard Integration**: Support for sending commands via clipboard
- 🔌 **Serial Communication**: Support for sending commands via serial port
- 🎨 **User-Friendly GUI**: Intuitive user interface built with Tkinter
- ⚡ **Efficient Command Sending**: Support for single line sending, selected text sending, and full content sending
- 📦 **Simple Compilation Process**: Quick compilation to executable file using PyInstaller
- 🎯 **Intelligent Terminal Recognition**: Automatically recognizes terminal types and adopts optimal sending strategies
- 🔍 **Reliable Focus Management**: Ensures commands are sent to the correct window

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows operating system

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Program

```bash
python complete_command_sender.py
```

### Basic Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Click the "拖拽选择" (Drag Select) button to select the target terminal window
3. Enter the commands to be sent in the text editor
4. Click the send button or use keyboard shortcuts to send commands

## 🔧 Compilation Guide

### Compilation Environment Dependencies

- Python 3.8+ 
- PyInstaller 6.0+ 

### Compilation Steps

1. **Install PyInstaller**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Compile the executable file** (Choose either method):
   
   **Method 1: Using spec file (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   pyinstaller cmd_sender.spec
   ```
   
   **Method 2: Using command line parameters directly**
   ```bash
   python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --name "cmd_sender" complete_command_sender.py
   ```

3. **Get compilation results**:
   - After successful compilation, the executable file will be generated in the `dist` directory
   - Generated executable file: `dist/cmd_sender.exe`

## 📖 Usage Instructions

### 1. Select Target Terminal

- Click the "拖拽选择" (Drag Select) button
- Move the mouse to the target terminal window and click
- The application will automatically identify the terminal type

### 2. Write Commands

- Enter the commands to be sent in the text editor
- Support for multiple lines of commands, one command per line
- Commands can be loaded from files (via the "File" menu)

### 3. Send Commands

- **Send current line**: Click the send button on the left side of the current line
- **Send selected text**: Select the text to be sent, click the "发送选中文本" (Send Selected Text) button in the toolbar
- **Send all content**: Click the "发送全部内容" (Send All Content) button in the toolbar

### 4. Select Sending Mode
